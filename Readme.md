# Script for Easy Installation and Configuration of X-ray Core Without GUI

You are likely familiar with control panels like 3x-ui, Marzban, and others. All of these panels are merely graphical front-ends for the X-ray core, designed to simplify its management and configuration. However, the core itself can run perfectly without any panels and can be fully managed via the terminal. The main advantage of using the "bare" core is that you donâ€™t need to bother with domain names and TLS certificates. The core can be installed and administered manually using the official documentation. This script is intended to simplify that process: it automatically installs the core on the server, creates configuration files, and sets up several executable files for easy user management.

## VPS for the Panel

To install the panel, you will need a VPS server. You can purchase one from [ishosting](https://bit.ly/3rOqvPE).
The service offers over 36 locations. If you don't need a specific country, choose the one closest to you.

## System Requirements

* 1 CPU
* 1 GB RAM
* 10 GB disk space
* OS: Debian 12 x64

## How to Use the Script

The script was created and tested on Debian 12 x64. It may not work correctly on other operating systems. To download and run the script, use the following command:

```sh
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServerTechnologies/simple-xray-core/refs/heads/main/xray-install | bash
```

## User Management Commands

**Show a list of all clients:**

```sh
userlist
```

**Show the connection link and QR code for the main user:**

```sh
mainuser
```

**Create a new user:**

```sh
newuser
```

**Delete a user:**

```sh
rmuser
```

**Generate a connection link for a user:**

```sh
sharelink
```

A file named `help` will be created in the user's home directory with a list of these commands. You can view it using the following command (run from the user's home directory):

```sh
cat help
```
